# Challenge Week 4 - Cloud Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks


### i. Suggested Kaggle Competition 📄

For this period, the suggested Kaggle competition is **Cloud Classification**.


### ii. Multiclass Convolutional Network "from Scratch" 💻

You should implement and evaluate a multiclass convolutional neural network from scratch using the `PyTorch` and `Torchvision` libraries. The goal is to classify clouds in the dataset provided by the competition.


### iii. Transfer Learning 🧠

Utilize a pre-trained network (via **Transfer Learning**) to classify clouds in the same dataset. Compare its performance and the observed differences with the previous "from scratch" method.


### iv. Evaluation of Additional Methods 📊

Analyze and apply **regularization** and **data augmentation** techniques to optimize your model's performance. Document the impact of these techniques on the results.


### v. Note 📝

The described activities are suggestions and can be modified according to the project's needs and objectives
